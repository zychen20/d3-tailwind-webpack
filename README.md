# D3.js Tailwind CSS Webpack Boilerplate

# About

I am doing a SVG animation project and find it annoying that I can't use IntelliSense because I'm using D3.js via a CDN.
Thus, I made this simple boilerplate so that I can see IntelliSense prompt and publish a preview via services like Netlify Drop.

Besides, I'm using Tailwind CSS for some quick styling. So I added it into the boilerplate as well.
